    loanAmount: `You can always re-apply for a home loan if your first loan application was rejected by the lender. However, there are a few aspects you must consider before doing so.

    Credit score: Since housing loans are generally long-term retail loans, lenders look into the applicantâ€™s repayment capacity before approving or rejecting a loan application. Your credit score plays a major role in deciding your repayment capacity against a loan.
    
    If you have a poor score on your credit report, chances of your loan application being rejected are high. The unsatisfactory credit score gauges your creditworthiness which banks and financial institutions consider before processing your loan application. Hence, it is advised to go through your credit score and credit report before you apply for a loan.
    
    In case you have a poor credit score, consider improving your score by making your debt repayments on time before you reapply for a housing loan again. If you do not know what your current score is, you can get your credit score along with the credit report on BankBazaar.
    
    Loan Amount: Since purchasing/constructing a home is a one-time investment, we often tend to overlook the financial costs involved in it. Banks and financial institutions fix the maximum loan amount you are eligible for by taking your present monthly income. There is a high chance your application was rejected because of the loan amount you have applied for.
    
    If the loan amount applied for exceeds your eligible loan amount, the lender can decide to reject your application. In such cases, you can consider increasing the down payment on your home loan to bring down the loan amount.
    
    Other Ongoing Loans: Banks can also choose to reject your home loan application if you have too many other ongoing loans. Since home loan lenders see to it that not more than 50% of your monthly income is being contributed to your loan repayments, any other ongoing long-term loans can result in your application being rejected.
    
    Having too many ongoing loans will not only impact your personal finances but also your repayment capacity. Hence, it is advised to clear the ongoing loans, if any, before you apply for a housing loan.
    
    Co-applicant: There can be instances where applications are rejected due to low income. In such cases, you can consider adding a co-applicant such as a member of your immediate family. This will increase the maximum amount you are eligible for as the income and creditworthiness of the co-applicant will also be taken into account while deciding your eligibility.
    
    Employment: In some cases, the employment of the applicant can act as the deciding factor on whether the loan application is being approved or rejected by the lender. Your application can be rejected if the lender learns that you have been switching between jobs frequently.
    
    Unstable employment can sometimes prove to have a negative impact on your loan application. On the other hand, stable employment with a recognised institution on your application can have a positive impact.
    
    In case your housing loan application was rejected, and you have only been working with the current employer for a short period of time. You can consider giving it some more time before re-applying for another one.
    
    Documentation: Housing loans include a lot of documentation such as identity proof, residential proof, bank account statements, income tax returns, income proofs, property papers, documents approved by concerned authorities, etc. Your loan lender can reject your loan application even if one of the required documents are not submitted.
    
    You can always consult the banksâ€™ customer relationship executives to assist you with proper loan documentation.`,
